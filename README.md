# thr-patch-manager

This is a simple patch manager for the Yamaha THR-10 modeling amp. The purpose of this manager is to separate the patches lin in indicidual patches files and vice-versa. Only the script to separate the lib in different files is ready.

It should work with all variations of the amp, I am using a THR-5 myself.

It is based on the [THR Footswitch](https://github.com/MathisRosenhauer/THR_Footswitch) (I should have the lib ready to use it with the footswitch, right? ;-)).

Also, bear in mind that I am not very proficient in Python, so maybe it is not in a really Pythonic way.
